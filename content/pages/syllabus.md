Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

ThereÂ is no prerequisite for this course.

Course Objective
----------------

This course provides ways to analyze manufacturing systems in terms of material flow and storage, information flow, capacities, and times and durations of events. Fundamental topics include probability, inventory and queuing models, optimization, and linear and dynamic systems. Factory planning and scheduling topics include flow planning, bottleneck characterization, buffer and batch-size analysis, and dynamic behavior of production systems. Graduate students are required to complete additional assignments.

Difference between Undergraduate and Graduate Version
-----------------------------------------------------

This course is offered to both undergraduate and graduate students. The difference occurs in the take-home assignments. Some problems or portions of problems will be required for the graduate students and optional (i.e., they may make a difference for borderline cases) for undergraduate students.

Grading
-------

The grading will be weighted as follows:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Midterm Take-Home Assignment | 35% |
| Final Take-Home Assignment | 55% |
| Problem Sets | 10% |
| Class Participation | Discretionary small change of grade\* 

Notes
-----

1.  Problem sets: We will distribute problem sets related to each subject that we cover. Detailed solutions will be provided a week later. They will be discussed in recitations.
2.  \*For students who end up being at the borderline between two grades, we will take into consideration evidence of diligence and effort, in the form of class participation, attendance to recitation and office hours, etc.
